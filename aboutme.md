title: About me
---

Currently, I am doing my MS from Texas A&M University, College Station, US. 

I am researching CPU Microarchitectures - specifically, architectures for High-Performance Computing workloads. Other topics that interest me are last-level cache fairness and QoS, prefetching, and GPUs.

Before starting my Master's degree I worked in multiple US-based semiconductor companies in India in design verification roles.
